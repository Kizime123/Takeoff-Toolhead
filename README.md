# Takeoff-Toolhead-Clamps
Is it about time to *takeoff* your current toolhead? Well you're in the right spot!

The **ONLY** fully open source SLM voron toolhead

An SLM toolhead using 3628s and [Chube](https://chubehotend.com), with no X loss. There will be some Y loss (17mm~ from hitting the front door) unless you have a [clicky clacky door](https://github.com/tanaes/whopping_Voron_mods/tree/main/clickyclacky_door), a v2.4 that allows moving the bed back, or a 4040-based frame, such as DoomCube

> [!WARNING]  
> For tridents, you need to cut the front left and rear leadscrew, or use [these](https://www.printables.com/model/486638-voron-trident-z-steppers-spacers) (recommended), to avoid losing travel

## How does that belt path work?
The belt path relies on you deflecting the belt with itself so that it's straight, the belt must be feed with another piece of belt (or itself) near the XY joints so it's parallel.
